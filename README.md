# Fixit
This app help the local problems faces by people get noticed by government esaily. The problems like
- DEVELOPMENT OF A REGIONAL PORTAL FOR  POSTING, TRACKING AND MONITORING THE DOMESTIC AND LOCAL ISSUES FACED BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC
- The problems like potholes, open manholes, overflowing garbage and other social problems in poor and underdeveloped areas takes a long time to get noticed and         resolved by the government.
- Due to the overwhelming number of responsibilities that the government officials must fulfill, many issues that affect the general public typically go unaddressed.
- Due to lesser awareness of the severity of certain problems the officials don't know which issue they should target first, and therefore are forced to choose the  -   ones which are more convenient to them.
- Secondary problems that are found in comparatively more developed cities are voicing our opinions. There are websites like “change.org” to do this and also create     petitions. However that too isn't able to solve it due to lack of monitoring.

# Services of Application

- A simple web app that enables the user to capture a picture of the cause of an issue and upload it onto a database where others can view and support their claim.
- If this issue has already been brought up by another person in the past, the individual may elect to "petition" it, and our algorithm will utilise that information     to assess how serious the problem is.
- There will also be a section dedicated to social movements so that more people are aware about them and get involved by posting photos, videos, location, and           problems.
- This information will then be sent to the government officials where they would take the necessary actions to solve the issue.
